# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example.

## Final Product

This is the home page that displays all products currently available. If a product has a quantity of zero, it will be marked as sold out, as seen above.

Users can login or register for a new account if they haven't already done so in the past.

When trying to look for a product to buy, users are able to sort them be categories.

Once a user has selected an item to buy, they can find it in their cart, like so. If a user's cart is empty, an alternate message will appear and politely urge them to continue shopping.
| Empty Cart | Full Cart |
| ---------- | --------- |

If the user attempts to purchase said item, they will be given a prompt to input a credit card number. Use the example provided at the end of this readme for this part.

If the order is successfully placed, the user will be presented with a confirmation message.

Users can also write reviews for products, and delete their review later if they so choose to.

Admins have the ability to add new products and categories so long as they sign in.
